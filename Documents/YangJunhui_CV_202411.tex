\textbf{Land Use Regulation as a Barrier to Entry: Evidence from Minimum Parking Requirements in Retail and Local Services}\\
\large
(job market paper) \href{https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6s49411cit1tgsrnsmwhh/YangJunhui_JobMarketPaper_202411.pdf?rlkey=od6mfnloa6fo6zvjmzc3e7etu&st=eo4ixm4y&dl=0}{[url]}

I study the cost impacts of minimum parking requirement (MPRs) for retail and local services firms. As a common North American land use regulation, MPRs require firms to provide parking proportional to size upon opening and operating. I derive exogenous sources of variation from a 2012 reform in Seattle that reduced MPRs in only parts of the city and created arbitrary boundaries. I find extensive margin effects of MPR reductions, which positively impacted firm entry, survival, and related local outcomes, implying MPRs increase firm entry and fixed costs. I build a dynamic game model of entry and exit to quantify, and I find MPRs raise entry costs by 24 percent. A census tract would have at least one percent more firms if its MPRs were removed. \\

In August 2015, Houston rolled out a complete redesign of its bus route network. This came in response to falling ridership, a new light rail system, and new employment centers. This paper evaluates the consequences for commuting patterns and welfare. Using old bus routes as the instrumental variable, at the census tract pair level, I find a one-minute travel time reduction due to the redesign led to a 0.94\% increase in the number of commuters from 2014 to 2018. I also find large extensive margin effects. Evaluated through a quantitative spatial equilibrium model with mode choice, the redesign was welfare-improving. My counterfactual exercises bring new insights on the importance of connecting buses to intermodal transfer points, population and employment centers. My contributions include that I provide a first study of the bus to the transit policy evaluation literature, and that I study a cheap re-optimization, instead of a costly expansion, of transit.

This paper examines the impact of global warming on the presence of ice roads in Northern Canada, which are crucial for transporting essential goods to remote Northern communities, particularly First Nations. In recent decades, the operational duration of ice roads has diminished, resulting in a higher reliance on costly supply flights. To assess the consequences on food security, we exploit data from Nutrition North Canada (NNC), which offers subsidies for shipping costs by air, ice road, or sea to eligible communities. As expected, the reduced availability of ice roads has led to higher prices and lower consumption. Our study employs these insights to simulate potential future scenarios driven by ongoing climate change and evaluates the costs and benefits of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of dwindling winter roads. \\
